A: Hi everyone! Welcome back to another episode of "Campus Talks." I’m your host, and today we’re going to take a closer look at the main campus of Ahmad Dahlan University. Joining me are Mr. Rizal, a senior staff member at UAD, and Laila, a current student. How are you both doing today?

B: I’m doing great, thanks for having me!

C: Same here, I’m really excited to talk about our campus!

A: Awesome! Let’s jump right into it. Mr. Rizal, can you start by giving us an overview of the main campus? What makes it unique compared to other campuses?

B: Sure! The main campus of Ahmad Dahlan University is located in Tamanan, Bantul, on the South Ringroad. It’s quite impressive with five main buildings, including the central 11-floor building. We have state-of-the-art facilities like elevators, escalators, and two libraries. It’s a modern campus built to cater to students' academic and mobility needs, which makes it stand out.

A: That’s really impressive. I’ve heard about the libraries—Laila, as a student, how do you find the library facilities?

C: Oh, I love the libraries! There are two of them on campus, and they’re great for studying. One of the best things is the access to online academic journals, which really helps with research. Plus, the atmosphere is really quiet, so it’s perfect for getting work done.

A: That sounds super convenient. Mr. Rizal, apart from the libraries, what other facilities are available for students?

B: Well, aside from the libraries, we have a laboratory building that supports hands-on learning for students, especially those in science and technology programs. We also have dormitories, which are a big plus for students coming from outside Yogyakarta. These dorms are well-equipped, with kitchens, common areas, and 24-hour security.

A: Laila, are you staying in the dorms?

C: Yes, I am! The dorms are really comfortable, and it’s great to have everything close by. The common room is a nice place to relax and meet other students after a long day of classes.

A: That’s awesome! Now, Mr. Rizal, I understand that the Islamic Center Mosque is a significant part of the campus. Can you tell us more about it?

B: Yes, the Islamic Center Mosque is actually one of the campus’s landmarks. Not only is it used for religious activities by students and staff, but it has also become a resting place for tourists visiting Yogyakarta. The mosque is architecturally beautiful, and it has become an icon in the city. And we’re planning to enhance the area even more with the construction of the Muhammadiyah Museum nearby.

A: Wow, that’s amazing! It sounds like the campus is becoming a cultural hub as well. Laila, do students spend a lot of time around the mosque?

C: Yes, we do. It’s a peaceful place to pray, and the area around it is also great for hanging out or studying outdoors. It’s become one of my favorite spots on campus because it’s so serene.

A: I can see why! Let’s talk about student life for a moment. Laila, what kind of extracurricular activities can students get involved in?

C: There are a lot of student organizations and clubs here. Whether you're into sports, arts, debate, or even entrepreneurship, there’s something for everyone. We often have events like seminars, workshops, and student-led activities that help build skills outside of the classroom. Plus, the common spaces are perfect for organizing events or just casual meetups.

A: That sounds like a great way to build community. Mr. Rizal, are there any future developments planned for the campus?

B: Yes, aside from the upcoming Muhammadiyah Museum, we’re planning to expand the dormitories to accommodate more students. We’re also looking at upgrading our digital infrastructure, especially for online learning, to make education more accessible to everyone.

A: It’s exciting to hear that the campus is growing and adapting to the future. Laila, what would you say to prospective students who are thinking about joining UAD?

C: I would say, definitely consider it! The campus has everything you need—from great facilities to a supportive community. Plus, the location is perfect. You really feel like you’re part of something bigger here.

A: That’s a glowing recommendation! Thank you both for joining me today. It’s been really insightful learning more about Ahmad Dahlan University's main campus.

B: My pleasure!

C: Thank you! I’m glad I could share my experience.
